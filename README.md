# SPQ - _Simply Product Quantization_

### What is Product Quantization?
I will suggest [this survey](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mta/6/1/6_2/_pdf/), which gives a great overview of what Product Quantization is its use cases.


### Library Details
SPQ is a C++ header-only library with no dependecies.  
SPQ is unfinished and will eventually contain 3 different loss functions to use for Product Quantization.  
These will be:
- Euclidean Loss ([Paper](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/pubs/2011/JDS11/jegou_searching_with_quantization.pdf))
- Inner Product Loss ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01469v1.pdf))
- Score-Aware Inner Product Loss ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10396.pdf))
